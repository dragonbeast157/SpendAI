# SpendAI

SpendAI is an AI-powered personal and business finance management application. The app provides users with intelligent spending analysis by connecting to their bank accounts or allowing them to upload financial statements. SpendAI delivers instant insights, anomaly detection, company policy compliance monitoring, and personalized financial coaching through an intuitive chat interface.

## Overview

### Architecture and Technologies

The SpendAI project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. 

**Frontend**:
- Built with ReactJS and Vite in the `client/` folder.
- Uses `shadcn-ui` component library and `Tailwind CSS` for styling.
- Client-side routing is managed by `react-router-dom`, with pages defined in `client/src/pages/` and components in `client/src/components/`.
- Listens on port `5173`.

**Backend**:
- An Express-based server located in the `server/` folder.
- Implements REST API endpoints.
- Uses MongoDB for database operations, managed via Mongoose.
- Handles user authentication using bearer access and refresh tokens.
- Listens on port `3000`.

Both parts are coordinated using `concurrently`, allowing them to run together with a single command.

### Project Structure

#### Frontend
- `client/src/pages/`: Contains different page components.
- `client/src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components.
- `client/src/api/`: Contains API request functionalities.
- `client/vite.config.ts`: Configures server proxy settings.

#### Backend
- `server/routes/`: Defines various API routes.
- `server/models/`: Contains Mongoose models.
- `server/services/`: Provides core business logic and interacts with models.
- `server/server.js`: Initializes and configures the Express server.
